            <h3>Upcoming events</h3>
            It would be really silly if the excitement of the next minute’s future were to be known. The reason the ‘next’ is revered and the ‘gone’ is done with is the sheer mystery of the upcoming and the blatant reminder of the past. As the month of November progresses, the institute of BIT Sindri shall stand witness to  yet another mesmerizing event, truly the baap of all events; the FOYC-2014. The sole event of the college designed and fabricated only to entertain and treat the freshers of the particular year. Moreover, lying down the pipe of plans we have a certain number of events at their last articulation stage and ready to set the tempo of the year high, but only we wish we could share something more about it …..
            Fret not, as of this moment it is true that what you’ve already witnessed is nothing short of a revelation but we promise you that the best is about to come.
