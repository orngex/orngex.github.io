            <h3>Lions Clubs – Ready to Help, Worldwide</h3>

            The talk about who we really are has its roots which track back to the year 1917, when on a fine day of June, the 7th, a Chicago based businessmen, Melvin Jones laid the founding stone to this pristine, secular, service membership organization. He had a spark of ingenuity which he mentioned to his colleagues, “What if these men who are successful because of their drive, intelligence and ambition, were to put their talents to work improving their communities”. This very thought of selfless service transcended down to the Leo Club, the youth wing of Lions Club International founded in the year 1957 by Jim Graver, the coach of a school basketball team in Pennsylvania. Since then the different versions such as Alpha, Omega Leo Clubs have been created keeping in mind the age of the members.
            The Leo club of BIT Sindri is an Omega Leo Club which has been at the helm of activity since the day of its inception. The club is run efficiently by the coordination and cooperation of the members of all branches belonging to all the years of engineering. The club is looked over by the club in charge, Prof. Amar kumar. The leo club of bit Sindri meets every Wednesday at 5:00 PM at the club room.
