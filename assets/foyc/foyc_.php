            <h3>FOYC</h3>
            <br>
            <i><b>Q: What is something that happens once in year and undoubtedly happens to be the most memorable day of your life?</b></i>
            <br>
            <br>
            Your Answer: My Birthday (that’s a layman’s reply!)
            First Year BITian’s reply: it has to be the FOYC!!!
            Regarded by most and and admired by all, this outstanding two day event happens to be the biggest blockbuster belter of a show witnessed by the campus denizens. FOYC has through the years created its benchmark and earned a notch above others. This event being solely for the first year students begins with the written test ‘Prarambh’ from which 65 elegants are selected who are further scrutinized through a audio-visual quiz round from which only the top 12 Elites are selected. Then comes the true test of character and grit as the 12 students battle it out in solo performance section ‘Have it in your own way’ and thus emerge the best of the best; the top 5 Freshers of the Year . But that’s not the end of it: these 5 FOYs are then peppered with a series of serious questionnaire from an expert panel consisting of final year students, alumni members, professors and other dignitaries present. The quiz ranges in variety from current events, national and international knowhows and even the not so common, common sense is put to test by some beautifully arranged myriad of questions. Based on the jury’s decision and also taking the score of the written test in mind the stage is the lit up to welcome the numero uno, the Fresher of the year.
            This was all about the contest, now it’s time to know something about the other programmes in the entertainment section starting with the Silverscreen :a miniature or sized-down version of adaptations of Bollywood hit flicks involving the team members to enact some famous scenes from the movies provided within the given time limit. Then comes to the scene the Roccoco: a short mime act which represents or depicts the theme provided to the participants. The section called Karaoke invokes the rhythm divine of all the bards and nightingales of the college, the event being a modified version of the age old ‘antakshari’. and last but not the least, the event on the ultimate dusk of the show, the event called ABCD(Anybody Can Dance ) has proved to be the eventual showstopper with eclectic dance and in the groove performances by freshers who sweat it out the personality as given to them by their views and opinions. This is followed by the Vocab round which involves the synonyms of the words being asked by the members and the answer being given by the audience. The final round takes a bout with geography and is hence aptly named: Around the world where questions related to different locations are asked and the audience answers for them. The Wednesday thus commences with the juvenile comments of the ‘tail-twister’ who speaks out the nature of that very meeting as well as the conduct of the members during the entire time which is followed by singing of the national anthem.
