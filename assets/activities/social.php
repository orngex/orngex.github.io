            <h3>Blood identification cum donation camp</h3>
            Every year the leo club of bit Sindri organizes in the arena of its social cause a mega blood identification-cum-donation camp. This one day event sees an all out gathering and healthy participation of the students and faculty as well as other residents of the institute’s campus. The call for the humanitarian cause has always received a humungous response with this year’s BDC reaching a record breaking donation of 175+ units. This event has through the years gained the attention and appreciation of the Coalfield region and beyond.
