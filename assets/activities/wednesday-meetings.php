            <h3>Wednesday meetings</h3>
            Following the rich and immaculate tradition of the Leo club, the members of the club meet every Wednesday at 5:00 P.M. at the designated club room. The event initiates with the Leo pledge wherein each member promises to uphold the sanctity and the virtues of the club and to let the club flag fly high. Henceforth the minutes of the previous meeting are read out. The entire proceeding is headed by the president who hence forth invites the members to host the interactive public-speaking rounds of Extempore: where the speakers are allowed to speak within a given time limit about the topic provided to them onstage. Next comes the round of Shipwreck: an innovative dumb charade-type round where the speaker is supposed to defend the personality as given to them by their views and opinions. This is followed by the Vocab round which involves the synonyms of the words being asked by the members and the answer being given by the audience. The final round takes a bout with geography and is hence aptly named: Around the world where questions related to different locations are asked and the audience answers for them. The Wednesday thus commences with the juvenile comments of the ‘tail-twister’ who speaks out the nature of that very meeting as well as the conduct of the members during the entire time which is followed by singing of the national anthem.
